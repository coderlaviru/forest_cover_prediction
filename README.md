**# forest_cover_prediction**#   Forest Cover Type Prediction

##   Overview

    This project aims to predict the type of forest cover for a 30m x 30m patch of land. The system will classify the forest cover into one of seven categories based on various environmental factors.

##   Dataset

  The dataset, `forest_cover_prediction.csv`, is an analysis dataset from the Forest Department performed in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.

  **Description of Columns:**

* **Elevation**: Elevation in meters.
* **Aspect**: Aspect in degrees azimuth.
* **Slope**: Slope in degrees.
* **Horizontal\_Distance\_To\_Hydrology**: Horizontal distance to nearest surface water features.
* **Vertical\_Distance\_To\_Hydrology**: Vertical distance to nearest surface water features.
* **Horizontal\_Distance\_To\_Roadways**: Horizontal distance to nearest roadway.
* **Hillshade\_9am**: Hillshade index at 9 am, summer solstice (0 to 255 index).
* **Hillshade\_Noon**: Hillshade index at noon, summer solstice (0 to 255 index).
* **Hillshade\_3pm**: Hillshade index at 3 pm, summer solstice (0 to 255 index).
* **Horizontal\_Distance\_To\_Fire\_Points**: Horizontal distance to nearest wildfire ignition points.
* **Wilderness\_Area1 to Wilderness\_Area4**: Wilderness area designation (4 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence).
* **Soil\_Type1 to Soil\_Type40**: Soil Type designation (40 binary columns, 0 = absence or 1 = presence).
* **Cover\_Type**: Forest Cover Type designation (Integer classification).

**Integer Classification of Cover Types:**

  * 1 - Spruce/Fir
  * 2 - Lodgepole Pine
  * 3 - Ponderosa Pine
  * 4 - Cottonwood/Willow
  * 5 - Aspen
  * 6 - Douglas-fir
  * 7 - Krummholz

    ##   Code and Analysis

    *(Based on `forest_cover_prediction.ipynb`)*

    **Libraries Used:**

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    #   Add other libraries used in your notebook
    ```

    **Data Preprocessing:**

    Based on common practices and the notebook, the following preprocessing steps were likely applied:

    * Handling missing values (if any).
    * Scaling numerical features (e.g., `Elevation`, `Aspect`, `Slope`) using StandardScaler.
    * Encoding categorical features (if any, although most features seem to be numerical or binary).
    * Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

    **Models Used:**

    The primary model used is likely:

    * Random Forest Classifier

    **Model Evaluation:**

    The models were evaluated using metrics such as:

    * Accuracy Score
    * Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
    * Confusion Matrix

    ##   Data Preprocessing üõ†Ô∏è

    The data was preprocessed by scaling numerical features and handling any missing values to prepare it for the classification models.

    ##   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç

    The EDA process likely included:

    * Analyzing the distribution of features using histograms and box plots.
    * Visualizing relationships between features using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
    * Examining the distribution of the target variable (`Cover_Type`) to understand class balance.

    ##   Model Selection and Training üß†

    A classification model, likely the Random Forest Classifier, was chosen to predict the forest cover type. The model was trained on the training data. Hyperparameter tuning might have been performed to optimize the model's performance.

    ##   Model Evaluation ‚úÖ

    The trained model was evaluated on the testing data using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix to assess its ability to correctly classify forest cover types.

    ##   Results ‚ú®

    The project aimed to accurately predict forest cover types. The results would highlight the performance of the classification model, including accuracy and the model's ability to correctly classify each of the seven cover types.

    ##   Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

    1.  Clone the repository.
    2.  Install the necessary libraries:

        ```bash
        pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
        ```

    3.  Run the Jupyter Notebook `forest_cover_prediction.ipynb`.

    ##   Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

    The `forest_cover_prediction.ipynb` notebook can be used to:

    * Load and explore the dataset.
    * Preprocess the data.
    * Train and evaluate machine learning models for forest cover type prediction.
